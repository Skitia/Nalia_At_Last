                              VERSION Beta
              A Skitia Project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nalia At Last is a very long awaited romance for Throne of Bhaal.

How the mod plays out will depend on if you have the De'Arnise Romance installed, the Nalia Romance installed, or neither.

If for some maniacal reason you have both installed, the Nalia Romance will be assumed since that one has you married at the end.

For non-EET games, you'll have an additional option to summon a romanced De'Arnise Nalia or the other Nalia Romance. 
Otherwise you'll have to summon standard Nalia and romance her.

Installation:
Order largely doesn't matter. Install as you would any other weidu Mod.

This upcoming project intends to provide a conclusion to the romances started by both De'Arnise and Nalia Romance.  Talks will vary based on which content you are using. 
This mod is also standalone, though this mod will be richer if you are using either the De'Arnise romance mod or the Nalia romance mod. Otherwise, the romance starts from ground 0 and must build first.

GAMEPLAY NOTES

There are two Romance Tracks, Standalone and the De'Arnise/Arnel Branch. The Nalia relationship is largely treated the same in the second branch, bar a few distinctions of the romance that occured 
in Arnel's mod, and some dialogue differences.

If you intend to go through the Standalone Romance, note the following requirements:
-Male
-Not in any other Bioware, Beamdog, Skitia, or Artisan romance. (Petsy and Yvette from Lava are checked as well.)

However, the following will eventually doom the romance:
-Low Reputation
-Evil Alignment
-Responses to the Solar that tend towards corruption

Nalia will view you as a danger to herself and will cut the romance to protect herself.

If you intend to go through the De'Arnise/Arnel Romance branch, the above will also doom the romance!
Note also that the romance has a bit of a bump after a few talks for the De'Arnise/Arnel Branch. You'll have to plow through Nalia's development before things will smooth through.

Some talks are triggered normally, while others occur at rest or after rest. Some await until certain events in the story, such as Saradush being sacked, or certain dialogues with the Solar.



FLIRTING

Like the De'Arnise Nalia, Nalia At Last also has flirting for Nalia. 
It starts after a few talks for the Standalone Branch, and is available right away for the De'Arnise/Arnel Branch.
She also initiates her own flirts. You can stop the initiating in the same way you flirt with her, by using the talk icon and clicking on her or her portrait.

FAQ (contains spoilers)

Q: Help! The romance appears to be stuck! What did I do wrong?

A: You should probably rest, or wait on the story. If you're worried you broke it, check if PGNaliaRomanceActive is at 3. 
If your reputation is lower than 10, you are evil, or you gave certain answers to the Solar (One bad answer won't hurt you though), it can also break.

Q: Why is this readme in the style of De'Arnise?

A: As a wink and nod to the greatness that came before.

Q: Are there new epilogues?

A: Yes, 5 in total. I tried not to veer too much from Nalia's ambitions, as I felt they were still core to her.

A: Why is this in Beta?

Q: Because the release date is technically not until September 30th.
